        <p>Terror by night! The village of Orlane Is dying.
		Once a small and thriving community. Orlane
		has become a maze of locked doors and
		frightened faces. Strangers are shunned, trade
		has withered. Rumors flourish, growing wilder
		with each retelling. Terrified peasants flee their
		homes, abandoning their farms with no explanation.
		Others simply disappear...</p>
		<p>No one seems to know the cause of the decay
		â€”why are there no clues? Who skulks through
		the twisted shadows of the night? Who or what
		Is behind the doom that has overtaken the
		village? It will take a brave and skillful band of
		adventurers to solve the dark riddle of Orlane!</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
		<p>This module Is designed for 3-6 characters of third through fifth levels. The adventure ranges from an 
		overland journey to a challenging underground adventure for especially brave (or foolhardy...) characters.
		A list of pre-rolled characters can be found in "The Heroes" section.</p>
		
		<p>At first, this adventure plays as more of a mystery game with plenty of roleplaying options. But be warned!
		Danger is around every corner! You never know when you might slip into a fateful encounter!
		Because this originnally was a module published in 1982 for <i>Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</i>, it does have more of
		an old-fanioshed type of play. This includes traps, tougher encounters, and zany puzzles. So it is encouraged
		that you check around those corners and check for traps!</p>
		
		<p style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Sage's advice:</b> "A little paranoia is good to have as an adventurer. But remember, stepping into dangerous scenarios
		is at the heart of who an adventurer is! If you don't want to risk the occasional pit trap, become a farmer instead!"</p>

		<p>Between the bandit-infested Dim Forest and the slime-coated pools of the Rushmoor, lies a fertile land.
		It was upon this land that Orlane itself was founded nearly a generation ago.
		Soon after the arrival of the first farmers, a temple to the
		goddess of agriculture, Merikka, was erected,
		and thus, the village of Orlane was born. The land here proved
		to be very rich, often producing crops half again as large as
		thosegrown in more mundane soil. Orlane quickly grew into a
		thriving community of 300 people.</p>
		
		<h3>Throughout the past year...</h3>
		<p>			the population of Orlane has
		undergone a steady decline. Many farmers have packed their
		possessions and, for unknown reasons, migrated to other, less
		fertile areas. Some homes have simply been found abandoned,
		with food on the table or crops unharvested in the field. No
		explanation has ever been offered for these strange disappearances.
		Sometimes the families have returned in a week
		or two, and other times they have never been heard from again.
		The friendly character of Orlane has vanished as those who
		remain have become suspicious of the strange occurrences.
		Families have drawn in upon themselves, rarely conversing
		with their neighbors. Now, strangers in Orlane are more often
		met with questions and challenges than friendly invitations.
		Something sinister is at work in Orlane!</p>

		I did my best to warn them of the dangers but they wouldn't listen to an old woodcutter. They might have bought maps from the town over 
		and heard all sorts of stories about the treasure that lie hidden in them mountains. But what they weren't prepared for was the bandits
		that jumped them as they crossed the bridge. As it turns out, they did have some nice weapons. I got silvered dagger off one of their corpses!"<p>

        <p>Create your character using D&D Beyond by clicking <a href="https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/57484496866930">here</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Valid Races: </b>Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, Half-Orc, Human, Tiefling</p>
	      <h4>Determine Ability Scores</h4>
		      <p>These rules are found in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook. The places that are different or special to my setting are in <b>bold font</b></p>
	      <p>There are three ways of determining your stats. The first is to generate your character's six ability scors randomly.</p>
		<p>Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. <b>If you finish rolling but don't have above a 15, roll again.</b></p>
	      <p><b>As you roll, put each total down in order of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (or you can just place them anywhere you like if you are not cool). I recommend using this homebrew rule if you would like to let the dice decide what type of character you want to play!</b>.
		<p>If you want to save time or don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>
	      <p>If you want to be weird you can use the variant: customizing ability scores found in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook."
